    <h3>Iam  study computer engineering at Kadoorie University,tulkarem<hr>
    It's been a year since I graduated.<hr>
    I joined this course because at this stage I feel that I need to know what I need to learn
    And what should I do to develop myself?<hr>
    I found Gaza Sky Geeks and I felt that my questions would be answered if I joined this training.
